HEALTHCARE SYSTEM


A healthcare provider has many separate systems across different departments and facilities - patient records, lab tests, imaging, billing. Data is isolated in silos. This makes aggregated analytics, reporting and exchange of patient information difficult. Any system changes must be replicated across departments. The inability to share patient data across clinical and operational systems severely impacts population health management, clinical effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. For example, automated identification of gaps in care is limited without a consolidated view across departments. The lack of coordination also leads to redundant testing, delays in care and billing issues. The healthcare provider needs an architecture that breaks down data silos to enable quality improvement and reduce costs. The solution involves identifying key microservices for clinical capabilities like patient record management and referrals.
